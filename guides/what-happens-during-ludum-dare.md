# What Happens During Ludum Dare?

Every Ludum Dare event consists of a few different stages, which run for over a month! With the Jam/Compo running over one weekend, twice times a year \(normally in April, December\). Below is a break down of what happens in a normal LD.

### 2.1. Choosing the Theme

Every Ludum Dare has a theme, that is chosen by the community in the weeks prior to the event. The stages to Ludum Dare's theme selection process are; Suggestion, Slaughter, Voting and occasionally Theme Fusion.

You can find more details about the individual stages and a guide to the theme in general in the [theme guide _\(coming soon\)_](https://github.com/zwrawr/LDguides/tree/46ef5366156a908e15d9af070bb13baa13de451e/ludum-dare/theme/README.md).

### 2.2. Theme Announcement

The final stage of theme voting normally closes one hour before the theme is announced.

Due to the massive spike in traffic that we receive when announcing the theme this site is likely to become unresponsive for a little while. But don't worry as well as the theme being announced on this site it is also announced elsewhere!

* Twitter [@ludumdare](https://github.com/zwrawr/LDguides/tree/46ef5366156a908e15d9af070bb13baa13de451e/guides/twitter.com/ludumdare/README.md).
* IRC as soon as the Compo and Jam start.

### 2.3. 48/72 Hours to make a game

### 2.4. Submissions Hour

Ludum Dare gives you an extra hour after the 48/72 hours ends in which you can submit your game. Submission actually open much earlier than this and we advise to you to try and submit early, if possible.

Ludum Dare doesn't host you games or source code, you have to host them on an external site.

You can find more details about hosting in the [hosting guide](https://github.com/zwrawr/LDguides/tree/46ef5366156a908e15d9af070bb13baa13de451e/ludum-dare/theme/README.md). You can find more details about how to submit in the [submission guide](https://github.com/zwrawr/LDguides/tree/46ef5366156a908e15d9af070bb13baa13de451e/ludum-dare/theme/README.md).

If we encounter technically issues with the website and people are unable to submit there games in time then the submission Hour may be extended.t

### 2.5. Voting

This is probably the most important part of the jam \(a part from making a game\). Everyone who made a game during the event plays, rates and gives feedback on there peers games.

The best way to get other people to vote on your game is to vote on other peoples games. Doing this earns you 'coolness' which make your game appear higher on the list of games to be rated. Leaving feedback on the games you rate also earns you "coolness". You are aiming to get at least 20 votes on your game, in general this means you need to vote on  around 20 games.

This stage normally runs for about 3 weeks.

You can find more details about the categories and voting in general in the [voting guide_\(coming soon\)_](https://github.com/zwrawr/LDguides/tree/46ef5366156a908e15d9af070bb13baa13de451e/ludum-dare/theme/README.md).

### 2.6. Results

Once the voting ends, the results go live!

At this stage you'll be able to see your games ranking as well as the ranking of other peoples games. The 'winners' in each category will also be announced and listed. This is a great time to go and play the games that the community decided were the best.
