## 2. How do I take part in Ludum Dare?

Every Ludum Dare event consists of a few different stages, which run for over a month! With the Jam/Compo running over one weekend, three times a year (normally in April, August and Decemeber). Below is a break down of what happens in a normal LD.

### 2.1. Choosing the Theme
Every Ludum Dare has a theme, that is chosen by the community in the weeks prior to the event.
The stages to Ludum Dare's theme selection process are; Suggestion, Slaughter, Voting and occasionally Theme Fusion.

You can find more details about the individual stages and a guide to the theme in general in the [theme guide *(coming soon)*](/ludum-dare/theme).

### 2.2. Theme Announcement
The final stage of theme voting normally closes one hour before the theme is announced.

Due to the massive spike in traffic that we receive when announcing the theme this site is likely to become unresponsive for a little while.
But don't worry as well as the theme being announced on this site it is also announced elsewhere!

### 2.3. 48/72 Hours to make a game

### 2.4. Submissions Hour

Ludum Dare gives you an extra hour after the 48/72 hours ends in which you can submit your game.
Submission actually open much earlier than this and we advise to you to try and submit early, if possible.

Ludum Dare doesn't host you games or source code, you have to host them on an external site.

You can find more details about hosting in the [hosting guide](/ludum-dare/theme).

### 2.5. Voting
This is probably the most important part of the jam (a part from making a game).
Everyone who made a game during the event plays, rates and gives feedback on there peers games.

The best way to get other people to vote on your game is to vote on other peoples games.
Doing this earns you 'coolness' which make your game appear higher on the list of games to be rated.
You are aiming to get at least 20 votes on your game, in general this means you need to vote on 20 games.

This stage normally runs for about 3 weeks.

You can find more details about the categories and voting in general in the [voting guide*(coming soon)*](/ludum-dare/theme).

### 2.6. Results
Once the voting ends, the results go live!

At this stage you'll be able to see how your game was ranked along with how other people did.  
The 'winners' in each catogoery will also be announeced and listed.
This is  a great time to go and play the games that the community think were the best.
