### Setup
If your just making a small change, GitHub's online editor works quite well.

For larger changes, you'll need to fork/clone this repo and then download it.
Once you've downloaded it, you should run the following command to setup the project.

```bash
npm install
```

### Editing
Some things to remember when writing.

* These guides are intended to be 'official Ludum Dare' guides, try to make your writing style reflect this.
* A lot of these guides are intended for people who haven't been involved with Ludum Dare for long.
    They might well be read by people before there first LD!

### Testing

There two things you should do once you've completed your edits.

* Proof read the files you've changed.

* Run the test suite (spell check)
```
npm test
```

Our test suite is also run via Travis CI
